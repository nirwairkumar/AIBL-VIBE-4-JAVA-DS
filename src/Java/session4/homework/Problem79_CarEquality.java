/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * Override toString() to show a car’s details. Override equals() to compare cars by content (e.g., brand and
 * model and/or year). In main, create two cars with the same data, print both, then compare using == and
 * .equals().
 * Input:
 * None.
 * Output:
 * Two toString() lines, then one line for == and one for .equals().
 * Example:
 * Car 1: Toyota Camry (2020)
 * Car 2: Toyota Camry (2020)
 * c1 == c2: false
 * c1.equals(c2): true*/
